# Android Application

The android application was quickly prototyped in MIT's APP Inventor which is found at [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/).  

This simple tool allows building of android application quickly with a drag and drop interface. Not my normal way of programing android applications, but it suits the purpose.

You can either directly download the built APK from [here](App2.apk). Or you can get the original app inventor code and import it into your own app inventor. [App2.aia](App2.aia)
